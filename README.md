# Development Environment Setup

Regardless of OS, I highly recommend looking into setting up the the Python [Virtual Environment System](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), 
but I especially recommend it if you're working on Windows.

## Package Installation

Required packages should be placed in the `requirements` file and can be installed with the command `pip install -r requirements`

Currently using:
```
pygame              - Game Development Framework
numpy               - Fixed width integer arrays for OpenGL
PyOpenGL            - OpenGL bindings and abstraction layer
PyOpenGL_accelerate - Additional abstractions and C bindings to reduce the signature of complex function calls
```
